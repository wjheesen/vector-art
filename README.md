# Vector-Art
2D vector art app built to illustrate use of [GL2D](https://github.com/wjheesen/gl2d).

The app is highly data efficient, as each shape is defined by only a color and a matrix transformation of shared mesh vertices.

Note: This an experimental app that is still heavily under development. The UI is temporary, and known bugs exist.
